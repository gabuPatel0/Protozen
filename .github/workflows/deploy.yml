# This workflow is disabled - using gh-pages package for deployment instead
# 
# We're using `npm run deploy:gh-pages` for deployment which:
# 1. Builds the project with GITHUB_PAGES=true
# 2. Deploys to the gh-pages branch using the gh-pages npm package
# 
# To use this workflow instead:
# 1. Uncomment the workflow below
# 2. Configure GitHub Pages to use "GitHub Actions" as source
# 3. Fix environment protection rules if needed
